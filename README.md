learn japanese with japanese songs.

this is for people who speaks Chinese.

The primary goal is read Japanese, not to talk in Japanese.
Though with songs, your pronunciation should be good.

By the way, why this project? why this idea?

This is a method that many people proposed, and my niece started with japanese. she does not understand the Japanese, she just sing along with songs.
so I think maybe this is effective. Let's try.
